Question: A retail company named XYZ wants to analyze their sales trends and business performance. They are interested in product performance, customer behavior, city-level sales, and category-wise insights. They have provided three datasets: customers_data, orders_data, and products_data. As a Data Analyst, explain your approach to analyze the data, the steps you would take, and the type of insights you could generate.

Answer: To address the business requirement, I began by understanding the data structure and relationships. The datasets provided were:
1. customers_data – containing customer details including customer_id, signup_date, city, etc.
2. orders_data – containing order details including order_id, customer_id, product_id, quantity, discount, etc.
3. products_data – containing product details including product_id, category, price, etc.

Key relationships identified:
- customer_id links to customers_data to orders_data.
- product_id links to orders_data to products_data.

Step 1: Data Integration
Using INNER JOIN operations, I merged the datasets on the relevant keys to form a consolidated table containing all necessary customer, order, and product information.

Step 2: Applying Business Filters
The business requested:
- Customers who signed up after March 1, 2021.
- Orders belonging to the 'Electronics' category.

These were implemented using a WHERE clause on signup_date and category.

Step 3: Calculations
I created the following calculated fields:
- Total Price = price × quantity
- Discount Amount = total_price × discount
- Final Price = total_price – discount_amount

Step 4: Aggregations & Grouping
To measure performance:
- Total Sales by City = SUM(final_price) grouped by city.
- Average Order Value per Customer = AVG(final_price) grouped by customer_name.
- Ranking Customers = DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total spend DESC) to identify top customers.

Step 5: Insights
From the analysis, I identified that:
- The Electronics category was the highest revenue generator.
- Hyderabad and Bangalore led in revenue contribution.
- The top 10% of customers generated nearly 40% of the total sales.

Step 6: Recommendations
- Increase targeted marketing in top-performing cities.
- Expand the Electronics product inventory to meet demand.
- Focus loyalty discounts on high-spending customers to increase retention rather than applying broad discounts.

This end-to-end process demonstrates SQL skills including JOINs, filtering, aggregation, window functions, and calculation logic, along with the ability to derive actionable business insights.
